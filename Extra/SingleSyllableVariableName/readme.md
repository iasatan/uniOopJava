# Variable Names

Compare the two assembly (.s) files. They are identical.

If you do not believe me, you can try it yourself (gcc -S test.c)

Single Syllable and normal variable names compile to the same assembly code.
There is no need to use them outside of loop variables in for cycles.

Shorter variables do not make the code faster.

Single syllable variables make the development time slower after the usage of 2. 

Single syllable variables make the code unmaintainable, because after a day/week/month you will have no idea what they mean.

Modern IDE-s help you write down variables and method names, so you still write 1-2 letters and an enter.
