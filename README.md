# uniOopJava

Tasks and their solutions for the course Object Oriented Programing (java) in University of Miskolc.

For the Students:<br />
Tasks are made avaiable when I get them.<br />
Solutions are pushed after the practice lesson (thursday 12-14).<br />
However following my GitHub account can be usefull (mostly for me), if you are interested only in this repository, it would be better to simply watch it (next to the name of the repository, on the other side), otherwise you wont get notifications when I update the repository.<br />

If you have any problems feel free to ask them in email or during the lesson.<br />
